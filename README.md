# About

A little app for automatically generating exchange gift pairings. The gift-giving graph produced will be acyclic (i.e., no two persons ever will be assigned to each other). Not yet very abstracted; it expects that an "admin" will enter the names of those invited into the database.

# Future

I intend this to be a Facebook app (create an event, run the app, get your pairings). But while I am not yet very proficient with the Graph API, we have this. ;D
